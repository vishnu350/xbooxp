#### Building the XBOO cable

Below describes how to connect a PC parallel port to the GBA link port,
allowing to upload small programs (max 256 KBytes). It was modified from
Martin Koth's description for building the xboo cable, and included here
as it is very difficult to find information on it now.

This is possible because the GBA BIOS includes a built-in function for
downloading & executing program code even when no cartridge is inserted.
The program is loaded to 2000000h and up in GBA memory, and must contain
cartridge header information (nintendo logo, checksum, etc) just as for
normal ROM cartridges.


## Basic Cable Connection

The general connection is very simple (only needs four wires), the only
problem is that you need a special GBA plug or otherwise need to solder
wires directly to the GBA mainboard (see Examples below).
  GBA  Name  Color                 SUBD CNTR Name
  2    SO    Red     ------------- 10   10   /ACK
  3    SI    Orange  ------------- 14   14   /AUTOLF
  5    SC    Green   ------------- 1    1    /STROBE
  6    GND   Blue    ------------- 19   19   GND
Optionally, also connect the following signals (see notes below):
  4    SD    Brown   ------------- 17   36   /SELECT  (double speed burst)
  3    SI    Orange  ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  5    SC    Green   ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  4    SD    Brown   ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  START  (mainboard) -----|>|----- 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 1N4148)
  SELECT (mainboard) -----|>|----- 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 1N4148)
  RESET  (mainboard) -----||------ 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 300nF)
Notes: The GBA Pins are arranged from left to right as 2,4,6 in upper
row, and 1,3,5 in lower row; outside view of GBA socket; flat side of
socket upside. The above "Colors" are as used in most or all standard
Nintendo link cables, note that Red/Orange will be exchanged at one end
in cables with crossed SO/SI lines. At the PC side, use the SUBD pin
numbers when connecting to a 25-pin SUBD plug, or CNTR pin numbers for
36-pin Centronics plug.


## Optional SD Connection (Double Speed Burst)

The SD line is used for Double Speed Burst transfers only, in case that
you are using a gameboy link plug for the connection, and if that plug
does not have a SD-pin (as such from older 8bit gameboy cables), then
you may leave out this connection. Burst Boot will then only work half
as fast though.


## Optional Pull-Ups (Improves Low-to-High Transition Speed)

If your parallel port works only with medium or slow delay settings,
try to connect 560 Ohm resistors to SI/SC/SD inputs each, and the other
resistor pin to any or all of the parallel port data lines (usually
outputs high to pins 2..9).


## Optional Reset Connection (CAUTION: Connection changed September 2004)

The Reset connection allows to automatically reset & upload data even
if a program in the GBA has locked up (or if you've loaded a program
that does not support special burst boot), without having to reset the
GBA manually by switching it off and on (and without having to press
Start+Select if a cartridge is inserted).
The two diodes should be 1N4148 or similiar, the capacitor should be
300nF (eg. three 100nF capacitors in parallel). The signals are labeled
on the mainboard, and can be found at following names / pin numbers:
RESET/CPU.125, SELECT/TP2/CPU.126, START/TP3/CPU.127.


## Optional Power Supply Connection

Also, you may want to connect the power supply to parallel port data
lines. Different parallel ports output different voltages/amperes
though, maybe using a large Z-diode could be used to get a stable
voltage with most ports. Even with strong ports, it'll probably not
work when inserting a very power-hungry cartridge into the GBA.


## Transmission Speed

The first transfer will be very slow, and the GBA BIOS will display
the boot logo for at least 4 seconds, even if the transfer has
completed in less time. Once when you have uploaded a program with
burst boot backdoor, further transfers will be ways faster. The
table below shows transfer times for 0KByte - 256KByte files:
  Boot Mode_____Delay 0_______Delay 1_______Delay 2_____
  Double Burst  0.1s - 1.8s   0.1s - 3.7s   0.1s - 5.3s
  Single Burst  0.1s - 3.6s   0.1s - 7.1s   0.1s - 10.6s
  Normal Bios   4.0s - 9.0s   4.0s - 12.7s  4.0s - 16.3s
All timings measured on a 66MHz computer, best possible transmission
speed should be 150KBytes/second. Timings might slightly vary
depending on the CPU speed and/or operating system. Synchronization
is done by I/O waitstates, that should work even on faster computers.
Non-zero delays are eventually required for cables without pull-ups.


## Requirements

Beside for the cable and plugs, no special requirements.
The cable should work with all parallel ports, including old-fashined
uni-directional printer ports, as well as modern bi-directional EPP
ports. Transfer timings should work stable regardless of the PCs CPU
speed (see above though), and regardless of multitasking interruptions.

Windows NT/2K/XP/etc do not allow executables to access the parallel
port directly - unless having installed a special driver that unlocks
access to the port.
Note: DOS and Windows 95/98/etc. are working fine without such drivers.

## Connection Examples

As far as I can imagine, there are four possible methods how to connect
the cable to the GBA. The first two methods don't require to open the
GBA, and the other methods also allow to connect optional power supply
and reset signal.
  1) Connect it to the GBA link port. Advantage: No need to
     open/modify the GBA. Disadvantage: You need a special plug,
     (typically gained by removing it from a gameboy link cable).
  2) Solder the cable directly to the GBA link port pins. Advantages:
     No plug required & no need to open the GBA. Disadvantages:
     You can't remove the cable, and the link port becomes unusable.
  3) Solder the cable directly to the GBA mainboard. Advantage: No
     plug required at the GBA side. Disadvantage: You'll always
     have a cable leaping out of the GBA even when not using it,
     unless you put a small standard plug between GBA and cable.
  4) Install a Centronics socket in the GBA (between power switch
     and headphone socket). Advantage: You can use a standard
     printer cable. Disadvantages: You need to cut a big hole into
     the GBAs battery box (which cannot be used anymore), the big
     cable might be a bit uncomfortable when holding the GBA.
Personally, I've decided to use the lastmost method as I don't like
ending up with hundreds of special cables for different purposes, and
asides, it's been fun to damage the GAB as much as possible.

Note:
The above used PC parallel port signals are typically using 5V=HIGH
while GBA link ports deal with 3V=HIGH. From my experiences, the
different voltages do not cause communication problems (and do not
damage the GBA and/or PC hardware), and after all real men don't care
about a handful of volts, however, use at own risk.
